2 will mainly be used, with Git/GitHub used for version control. A
semi-functional game should be expected due to the lack of time and experience,
and improvements could still be made even after the course is completed</p>

        </h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-5">Although the gaming industry is not something new, which is
introduced to the mass media from the 1970s with the introduction of pong and
in constant progression ever since, it only truly explodes a few decades ago,
to the point of being an industry that worth hundreds of billions of dollars
and with billions of players around the world, due to the relative ease of
accessibility and recently, due to lockdown and the subsequent layoffs makes
gaming a popular activity and creates a huge demand for games. As such, the
current market is filled with games which incorporate advanced game engine and
graphic but becoming increasingly questionable in both the gameplay’s quality
and the legality of its microtransaction practices. And because of that, many
people want to go back in time, to the era of 2D games with the nostalgia of
the past but with the current advancement in technology. That is why this
project can be interesting and can have promising results.</p>

will be something that represents the game’s theme and will be something all
members agree with.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The buttons: As for the basic
design, there will be two buttons: “START” and “QUIT” placed on both side in
positions that is symmetrical to each other. Those buttons should be able to do
the task which is implied in their name: to start the game and to quit running
the program.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Background images: This part will
show the game’s theme and can be used as background for many stages. As such, to
best enhance the experience and to suits the aesthetic of the project, it is
best that the images use for background purposes should be 8-bits or at worst,
16-bit that is either space or retro themed.<br>

For the sound effects, they also have the role of differentiating different effects, attacks, and actions. For this project, due to the situation of copyright and usage issues, only royalty-free soundtracks and free sound effects online is in consideration to be used for this project.

        </h6>
        <p class="u-text u-text-8">The game lets you take the persona of a man who controls a pixelated starship
on the journey across the galaxy, Throughout the journey, he meets and have
confrontations against others who are in the process of amassing an armada and

        <p class="u-text u-text-10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.
Basic gameplay: Like the older shoot ‘em up games that this project is inspired
by such as galaga, space invaders or asteroids, the player starts the game at
the bottom of the screen with three repairs and use arrow and keys to command
the ship to exchange fire with waves of enemy ships flying in close formation
that appears from all sides of the screen and fire in either volleys or in patterns.
Every time the ship either got hit by the enemy’s shots or collides with the
flagship/mothership, a repair is used. If the ship got hit but ran out of repairs,
then the ship will be shot down and the choice to respawn appears. After the
player clears the small ships, a flagship or mothership will appear, depending
on the stage that the player is in. These ships not only have more hit points
but also the ability to either fire guided munition or deploy small crafts to
act as shield and extra firepower. Each stage is differentiated by different
background image and if possible, background music and different enemy ships
skin.&nbsp;</p>

Fire enhance upgrade and special mode: In the game, the special mode is
activated with a key that allows the ship to have a temporary increase in a
certain aspect for &nbsp;limited in both time
and usage. There are also items that can upgrade the ship’s firepower that can
be picked up from defeated flagships/motherships.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Lives management and respawn
limitation: The player starts the game with three repairs and a backup ships
and proceeds to exchange fire against the enemy. Every time the player got&nbsp; hit, a repair is used and the ship will be
back to full fighting conditions, with all points and upgrades picked up
before. Once the ship ran out of repairs and the ship got shot down, there will
be a choice to return to the battle in a backup ship. The player if returns in
a backup ship will comes back to the fight with points reset and all upgrades
from before gone. Repairs can be picked up by shot down special enemies, while
backup ship can only be used only once.&nbsp;

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-palette-2-base u-text-2"><b>Tools and technology:</b>
        </h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3">For
this project, two software should be enough to cover the basic functions of
building a game: Construct 2 or Construct 3 to make the game itself, and GitHub
for version control and file management. Construct is a game editor aimed at
non-programmer with the use of visual programming. It is a HTML5-based game
engine which is written in C++ and Java Script. While Construct 2 and Construct
3 has a free version, Construct2’s free version can function well on its own,
Construct3 only offer a wider range of functions, but limited at the number of
events can be coded into the game. GitHub is a hosting service for the purpose
of software management. It takes the form of a web-based service that allows
the user to create and modify repositories and focus on the aspect of bring a
hub for code-sharing and hosting.</p>

        </h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-6">As
for this Project, the utmost importance skill needed for this project is the
knowledge of using Construct game-engine effectively to create a functional
game. After that is design capability and report-writing skills. As for GitHub,
throughout the last few weeks, basic knowledge for using GitHub effectively as
a platform for version control is taught in the course’s tutorial section. Concerning
Construct, the next one or two weeks should be enough to learn the basic of
using this game engine. Because Christmas break will take place right after the
moment this assignment is submitted, there should be time to learn the
necessary skills.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-8">If
the project is completed, the result will be a fun and quite challenging game that
is not only a good way to relax and kill time but also a nice exercise to train
for better hand-eye coordination.&nbsp;</p>

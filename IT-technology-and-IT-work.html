        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Artificial Intelligence(AI) is the term to describe the capability of
computer software / computer-controlled robots to perform tasks that are
normally think about when talking about sentient being or tasks that can be
considered intelligence if performed by organic beings. The field of study
regarding AIs is very broad, with many subset and applications, one of which is
machine learning. Machine learning is the field of study of computer algorisms
that find and analyze pattens and relationships from a set of data and from
which, concludes a possible outcome from those data. When compare to natural
intelligence, AI excels at being a very fast learner that can absorbs a very
large amount of data and to classify them according to their attributes. AIs
although have a very high development cost, its operation cost can be very
consistent and inexpensive once installed in a computer. The best advantage of
AIs so far is that it can be very easy for the duplication and documentary of
knowledge, and AIs can store those knowledges permanently, unlike natural
intelligence which can only store information for a limited amount of time,
takes a lot of resources and time to duplicate and sometimes the knowledges
that is duplicated can be incomplete. As of now, the field has developed to the
point of AIs can have many applications on human life such as</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3">- Image recognition: the systems can understand differentiate visual
inputs thanks to deep structured learning and development is the field of
computer vision. This application already having an impact on many fields of
work: the police use facial recognition software to compare the characteristic
of a suspected individual to the existing database and draw the conclusion
based on the similarity between the two.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-5">- Expert systems: those are systems that try to
mimic human by focus on a certain domain. Currently, expert systems can act as
support to decision maker by suggesting course of actions and possible effect
that action can make if taken or if the situation demands, take the action by
itself.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-6">-
Gaming: for a long time, AI is an essential part of rigid rule-based games such
as chess or different ways of playing the game of cards as bots to act as the
adversary. For this purpose, the AI can come up with many possible positions
and can adapt to the player’s styles after every match by the method of try and
false. The technology of AI and its subset of machine learning is also useful
in shooting game, especially FPS or strategy game, where the AI can constantly
adapt to the player’s playstyle and devise effective countermeasures</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-7">As for the close future,
the likeliest possible for the field of AI is to further improve upon existing
capabilities, such as makes the gaming bot better adapts to the player and make
it better realize the actions that is designed to misinform the bot and make it
learn the wrong things. As for the next few years will see AI further integrate
into society, taking roles is management, analyze the effects that cab be
afflicted before any decision is made and operating industrial machineries.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-1">&nbsp;. Of course, the increasingly clear
involvement of AI will have profound impact many facets of society. In the
field of stock exchange, AI is already used for high-speed transaction by
analyzing a very large amount of data and the decide to trade at the optimal
price with the speed and accuracy far surpass any human agency. In terms of
healthcare, AI can be used to diagnose diseases based on the finding possible
symptoms, and prodded adequate treatment from those findings. In business and
industries, AI can be used to manage resources and databases, operate heavy
machinery with great accuracy for manufacture or to operate in hazardous area such
as nuclear reactor maintenance. AI can also act as customer service or being
advisor. And in places such as Japan, they even turn AI into human’s companion, amlost completely replace the need for a spouse. But with this new possibility that AI
brings there also arose many questions, especially about the issue of jobs and the
future of many services. Whole fields of work will see mayor restructure and
massive layoffs, which will hit especially hard on blue-collar jobs in fields
such as manufacture, mining, agriculture, logging, janitor, … .These jobs
employs hundreds of millions of people, even billions of people, the vast
majority of whom are paid very low and is not financially able to learn new skills
that can get them a new job and government-subsidized learning center are often
underfunded and often teach unusable skills. The service sector will also have
to perform massive layoffs as robots controlled by AI can perform almost any
task that is currently performed by human staff, it does not need wage, does
not form unions, and does not flinch when a Karen comes and makes a tantrum in
the shop. However, AI can also open new opportunities and create new jobs, as works
such as coding in high demand. AI can also create new opportunities in entrepreneur,
as people has the means to set up effective business by themselves.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-3">. To me personally, AI is
something that will be much needed both short and long terms. For my project
idea’s game, utilizing artificial intelligence will be a very big help with
both gameplay and the ability to keep player replaying after finishing the
game. The AI will adapt to the player’s playing style and adapt accordingly.
This is to ensure challenging gameplay as every time the player come back to
the area, the ships become stronger and the boss becomes more and more tactical
in its movement overtime. As for the long run, with the fact that I am studying
about Information technology, the field of Artificial Intelligence will become
the backbone of many project that I will be involved into in the future. For my
family, AI will be something that will help them improve their work efficiency,
better save their money, and improve their standard of living by being an
advisor, a companion who helps them access modern technology. Its vast database
can help my brother improve his study by analyze his personality and give him extra
lectures that enhance his talents and help mitigate his shortcoming.</p>

        </h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Virtual reality (VR) is
the result of using computer science to create an environment that can be
either similar or different from the world that we are currently living in.
With VR, one can create a totally immersive environment by using an application
programming interface that supports VR devices, such as WebVR. To make VR fully
immersive, all senses must be under the control of the system, and to feed data
from the virtual world to the user, who is still staying in the realm of the
real, special VR gears are needed. The most basic, which is the most iconic
when talking about virtual technology is the head-mounted display. It creates
the feeling of virtual stimulation by generate two images and display those
images from two different perspectives while also enhance that experience by
incorporating features such as head-tracking. Along with the famous headset,
there are also wire gloves, a 3D mouse, motion controller, and optical sensors
to further enhance the experience. There are also VR cameras that can be used
to create VR 360 interactive photography, but with low resolutions or in
compressed format.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-3">Augmented reality is the result of using computer systems to augment
real-world scenery include extra information, sound, or filter, and allow
real-time interaction between the user and the system, while the user still
maintains a presence in the real world, with most scenes unaffected and not
under control by the system. AR works by register objects from the real world
in the scene, then insert the enhancement graphic, audio, or other senses and
then track them with the 3D objects and change them in real-time, depending on
the user’s action. Augmented reality systems need three main components to
function properly: a display, a tracking system, and a computing device.
Luckily, all three of them are already integrated into the average smartphone
that a person normally owns, with the phone’s cameras act as both the display
and serve the purpose of tracking while the phone’s computational power is
enough to fill the role of being the AR system’s computation device.</p>

        <h5 class="u-text u-text-6"><b>- Applications of VR:</b>
        </h5>
        <p class="u-text u-text-7">In the entertainment industry, cinemas have been using this technology
for a long time, notably with the service of 3D cinema. Videogames with VR
compatibility has seen an explosion of number and interest since the 2010s,
with a new generation of commercial headsets released by HTC, Oculus, and Sony
that makes VR becomes cheaper and more accessible to the mass. The idea of
events hosted in the virtual realm has been in consideration for a long time.
Thanks to the outbreak, this idea has become a way for events to be hosted
without causing any health and safety hazards</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-8">VR technology also has the potential for usage in the medical industry.
Medical schools can train their students using simulated VR programs for
high-risk operations such as surgeries without risking the lives of patients in
the hand of inexperienced students.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-9">Due to its nature of creating an immersive environment, virtual reality
can have a big impact on education and training. Courses that used to be very
expensive like engineering or very dangerous such as parachuting, or combat
drill can now become cheaper thanks to the fact that students can interact with
3D objects and it will react accordingly that is similar to field practice.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-6">&nbsp; . As AR/VR further integrate
into society, it will certainly leave a big impact on human life in many
fields. One such field is medicine. AR/VR can help improve medical service
quality by improving the student’s training and enhance services. A medical
student can train with performing operations using VR systems and have
information and can contact other doctors on their display for real-time
discussion during operation. Another field that will see a big impact from this
technology is the film industry. With VR, filmmakers will have greater
flexibility in filmmaking.&nbsp; The director
can choose to shoot a scene from all angles, instead of choosing only one.
Viewers can also have this flexibility in choosing an angle to watch the movie.
For AR, film directors can use their talent to the fullest to create VFX that
resembles reality and to see the pre-rendered version of what they are doing.
Although AR/VR can have a very positive impact on a human’s standard of life,
it will also cause new problems. One of which is that just like the Internet,
once these technologies are fully integrated and institutionalized, there arose
a question: Is what appears in front of me the truth? And if so, who is there
to guarantee it as such? Especially with the modern world with certain private
companies having an almost monopoly on the Internet, have enormous lobby power
against politicians, and can dodge regulations, what regulation will be needed
to ensure that the market of AR/VR won’t share the same fate?</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-7">&nbsp; . Personally, the implementation of AR/VR on a large scale will have a
huge impact on my life also as my family and to those around me. On the short term,
AR/VR can be implemented to my project idea, if it’s chosen for assignment 3, as
a form of extra stage or as a separate game mode. This will give the project’s
result a nice extra gig to kill time. The use of VR/AR in training will further
implement in many fields, especially during the current situation. On the long
run, when the price for devices drop to the point of mass adaptability, things
like car’s counters can have AR technology built in as it will make navigation
much easier. If possible then I would like to replace the prospect of marry my fiancée
with having VR spouse, as it will be extremely efficient, especially when
talking about long term planning. It won’t cheat on you, won’t bring drama to
your life, and it certainly won’t try to file for divorce to the biased family court
and split your property and childcare right after cheating against you.</p>

        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-3">A developer’s workday usually starts by checking
mails for updates and communication between members and between departments.
Their work is mainly about software and programs. And as such, a large part of
their daily work revolves around coding and debugging. They can work as
freelancers hired by clients or work in corporations in projects both large and
small. Besides coding, he also has to work effectively in a group. For that, He
has to go to meetings for discussions about the situation and the project’s
path. They also frequently check their repositories on services such as GitHub
and code review, so that codes with errors don’t get to the production phase.
Besides interaction with their peers or with their clients, they also interact
with the corporation’s department in the form of surveys. These surveys either
be daily or happens once a year. In the modern workplace, in the West at least
can have a very flexible workplace, with they can spend their time working
either in the office or at home. However, due to the outbreak and the
subsequent lockdown, working in the office has become a safety hazard and such,
most of their work is done at home. The most challenging part of becoming a developer
is to effectively cooperate with people as a group to produce results that can
satisfy the requirements without being heavily affected by internal friction
and delays.</p>
